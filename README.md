[Preview GitHub Pages](https://nyan-left.github.io/threejs-webpack-typescript-eslint-template/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/nyan-left/threejs-webpack-typescript-eslint-template
```

cd threejs-webpack-typescript-eslint-template

[ThreeJS documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/).

### Starting Development

The template is a fully-working example, so you may try it right away. You may start up the development server using

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts an HTTP server listening on `localhost` and open up your default browser.

### Building

To make a production build, simply run

```bash
npm run build
```


### Github Actions


This template contains three github actions:

`build.yml` This runs on every push and creates a production build.

`dependabot-auto-pr.yml` This auto-approves pull requests generated by dependabot if the above action passes.

`release.yml` - When creating a new tagged release, will create a production build and push it to gh-pages branch.

Enjoy!
